    <p class="intro-text">
      At TechRes, we like to keep things simple, transparent, and stress-free. Hereâ€™s exactly how your appointment process works from start to finish:
    </p>

    <div class="steps-container">
      <div class="step">
        <h3>1. Book an Appointment</h3>
        <p>Head over to our Appointment Page and tell us what you need.
          Youâ€™ll select your service (like Phone Repair, Custom PC Build, Controller Fix, or Video Edit), and choose the issue youâ€™re having from our common list.
          You can even add a second issue if something else is acting up, no guesswork needed.
          
          Weâ€™ll also ask for your contact info and a preferred date to get things started.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>2. We'll Reach Out</h3>
        <p>Once you submit the form, you'll immediately receive a confirmation email with a summary of your request.
          This includes:
          
          The services and issues you selected
          
          A rough price estimate (so you know what to expect)
          
          Your appointment order number (for easy tracking)
          
          Donâ€™t worry â€” weâ€™ll still review everything before locking in the final price.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>3. Work Begins</h3>
        <p>Once weâ€™ve got your device, weâ€™ll get to work, whether itâ€™s a full hardware repair, a speed tune-up, or editing a full-blown video.
          Weâ€™ll send updates so youâ€™re always in the loop and know how things are going behind the scenes.
          
          We take pride in fast, high-quality work, and treat your tech like itâ€™s our own.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>4. Pickup & Payment</h3>
        <p>As soon as your project or repair is complete, youâ€™ll get a final message from us.
          At that point, weâ€™ll arrange your payment and get your device back in your hands, either by pickup or delivery.</p>
